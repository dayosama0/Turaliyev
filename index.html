        <p>Im a Software Engineering major student. I chose this course conciously, hoping to learn new branch of programming world.
            Usually, I prefer not having any expectations for something to not be dissapointed furtherly but im setting my mindset on the:
            "Destiny is on my side, so am I". It helps a lot with anxiety and usually i get lucky with such statements in my head.
            And I am convinced that I'll ace this course.</p>
